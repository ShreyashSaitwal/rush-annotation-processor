# Rush Annotation Processor
Annotation processor for extensions built using Rush.

> **Note**: The `annotations` and `processor` modules in this repository now live in [rush-cli](https://github.com/shreyashsaitwal/rush-cli) repo. The `runtime` module is planned to be moved in its own separate repo, after which this repo will be archived.
